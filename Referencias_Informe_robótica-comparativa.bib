   abstract = {There is the increased application of new technologies in manufacturing, service, and communications. Industry 4.0 is the new fourth industrial revolution, which supports organisational efficiency. Robotics is an important technology of Industry 4.0, which provides extensive capabilities in the field of manufacturing. This technology has enhanced automation systems and does repetitive jobs precisely and at a lower cost. Robotics is progressively leading to the manufacturing of quality products while maintaining the value of existing collaborators schemes. The primary outcome of Industry 4.0 is intelligent factories developed with the aid of advanced robotics, massive data, cloud computing, solid safety, intelligent sensors, the Internet of things, and other advanced technological developments to be highly powerful, safe, and cost-effective. Thus, businesses will refine their manufacturing for mass adaptation by improving the workplace's safety and reliability on actual work and saving costs. This paper discusses the significant potential of Robotics in the field of manufacturing and allied areas. The paper discusses eighteen major applications of Robotics for Industry 4.0. Robots are ideal for collecting mysterious manufacturing data as they operate closer to the component than most other factory machines. This technology is helpful to perform a complex hazardous job, automation, sustain high temperature, working entire time and for a long duration in assembly lines. Many robots operating in intelligent factories use artificial intelligence to perform high-level tasks. Now they can also decide and learn from experience in various ongoing situations.},

   abstract = {An array of developmental disorders known collectively as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that can cause significant social interaction, communication, and behavioral challenges. To remedy this autistic impact at its very early stage, researchers are focusing their attention on robotics research with humanoid robots. It has been claimed that under certain circumstances, children with ASD (CwASD) interact more actively and spontaneously with robots than humans. Therefore, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a beneficial approach in training CwASD to abate their autism disabilities. This paper extensively reviews the prior findings on HRI for CwASD. With some critical analysis, a couple of findings have been highlighted to address the research gaps on the effectiveness of the intervention sessions administered by the robots. A total of nine traits of autism, intervention sessions administered by various tasks, different types of robots used, number of CwASD’s along with their age, diagnosis methods applied to quantify the autism levels, and, finally, the outcomes with identified research gaps have been analyzed. With some comparative depictions, the reader can visualize the broad scenario and overall research condition of robot-assisted training (RAT) for CwASD. This review recommends employing robots in supervised applications to enhance therapeutic effectiveness, broaden acquiescence, and inspire trust among practitioners, CwASD, and guardians. Overall, RAT is a promising use for intelligent social robots, especially for helping CwASD achieve therapeutic and educational goals. We expect interdisciplinary collaboration to address its difficulties quickly.},

Robotic‐assisted keyhole surgery, compared with conventional keyhole surgery, improves surgical performance without increasing operating time, minimises blood loss and intra‐ or postoperative complications, while reducing the need to revert to abdominal surgery. Moreover, surgeons using a robot experience fewer skeletomuscular problems of their own in the short and long term than those operating without a robot as an additional tool.</p>},

   abstract = {Existing studies indicate the use of the Socially Assistive Robotic (SAR) system has enormous potential to advance therapeutic interventions in the learning process of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Interactive technology, including the use of educational video games, can motivate ASD children to engage by adopting the technology as part of their communications tools. The complexity in the integration of various components of SAR linked to educational/serious games hinder the modularity and scalability of these robotic systems. This work proposes the design of an architecture for a SAR platform through the integration and reproduction of robot prototype, “Loly 1.0”. Loly 1.0 has mechanical movements, audio, and gestures connected to educational games in real-time. This will support the learning process of ASD children. The robotic platform architecture design is comprised of three main parts: robot, educational game, and cloud services. A proof of concept of the SAR prototype was per-formed with non-ASD and ASD children. Evaluation and analysis of “synchronized operational precision between robot and video game” and “degrees of attention and usability” will be conducted. The lessons learned during the testing process will help to improve the architectural designs of hardware/software integration and connectivity. The results of reproducing a SAR prototype will be to attract the attention of an ASD child through the use a video game to engage the process of “learn by playing”. This will contribute to the design of engaging and personalized Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) and Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) technology beneficial for inclusive education.},

Robots provide benefits such as relieving loneliness and enabling communication. Engineers are trying to build robots that look and behave like humans and thus need comprehensive knowledge not only of technology but also of human cognition, emotion, and behavior. This need is driving engineers to study human behavior toward other humans and toward robots, leading to greater understanding of how humans think, feel, and behave in these contexts, including our tendencies for mindless social behaviors, anthropomorphism, uncanny feelings toward robots, and the formation of emotional attachments. However, in considering the increased use of robots, many people have concerns about deception, privacy, job loss, safety, and the loss of human relationships. Human–robot interaction is a fascinating field and one in which psychologists have much to contribute, both to the development of robots and to the study of human behavior.</p>},

Given the rapid pace of technological advancement, the development of intelligent and efficient surveillance solutions has garnered significant interest, particularly within the realm of smart city (SC). Surveillance systems have been transformed with the emergence of edge technology (ET), the Internet of Things (IoT), and deep learning (DL) to become key components of SC, notably the domain of face recognition (FR). This work introduces a smart surveillance car robot based on the ESP32-CAM micro-controller, coupled with a FR model that combines DL models and traditional algorithms. The Haar-Cascade (HC) algorithm is employed for face detection, while feature extraction relies on a proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) and predifined DL models, VGG and ResNet. While the classification is made by two distinct algorithms: Naive Bayes (NB) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Validation experiments demonstrate the superiority of a composite model comprising HC, VGG, and KNN, achieving accuracy rates of 92.00%, 94.00%, and 96.00% on the LFW, AR, and ORL databases, respectively. Additionally, the surveillance car robot exhibits real-time responsiveness, including email alert notifications, and boasts an exceptional recognition accuracy rate of 99.00% on a custom database. This ET surveillance solution offers advantages of energy efficiency, portability, remote accessibility, and economic affordability.},

This study systematically examined 22 peer-reviewed empirical research articles on the use of educational robotics to develop CT in young learners (pre-kindergarten to 6th grade) published between 2012 and 2021. The findings revealed that using robotics activities to develop CT has mostly been studied in the formal education settings with the duration of robotics curricular activities ranging from 80 minutes to 24 hours. The five CT skills studied most often include Sequencing, Conditionals, Loops, Debugging, and Algorithmic Thinking. The different versions of LEGO Mindstorms are the most frequently adopted robotic kits in the examined studies. The most frequently adopted learning and instructional strategies in the robotics activities include collaborative learning, project-based learning, and embodied learning. This paper identified and discussed developmentally appropriated CT skills, robotics kits, and pedagogical approaches suitable for supporting CT development in young learners. The findings can guide educators and instructional designers for future robotics activity design and development endeavors. This paper also identified gaps in the current research and recommended directions for advancing research in adopting robotics to develop CT in young learners. Computational thinking (CT) has evolved into a fundamental skill for K-12 students. A report released by the United States White House has identified developing computational literacy as one of the pathways to succeed in science, technology , engineering, and math (STEM) education, and specified an objective for this pathway as to "make computational thinking an integral element of all educational activities" (Committee on STEM Education, 2018, p.23). National curriculum standards and frameworks for STEM subjects have included CT as a critical skill (Burleson et al., 2018), which underscores the urgency for developing CT in all learners.},

Industrial revolution has completely transformed the social and economic life of an individual. It started in the seventeenth century with the use of simple steam engines has come a long way. Every major breakthrough in the technology changed the face of manufacturing industries. At present, we are in the era of Industry 4.0 which is hailed as the age of cyber-physical systems that has taken manufacturing and associated industry processes to an unforeseen level with flexible production including manufacturing, supply chain, delivery, and maintenance. This chapter presents an in-depth discussion on various aspects of Industry 4.0, its beginning, the founding pillars of industry 4.0. In addition to that other allied rudiments such as cross-technological, functional, talent and business developments are also discussed from the perspective of real time scenarios. This chapter also previews detailed knowledge about horizontal-vertical system integration and supply chain that aids in enabling and designing smooth manufacturing process in order to gain more profit.},

Our conceptualization is based upon the integration of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship, evolutionary economics, and innovation systems approach. It consists of a theoretical definition and a stylized process model. According to this view, knowledge-intensive innovative entrepreneurs are involved in the creation, diffusion, and use of knowledge; introduce new products and technologies; draw resources and ideas from their innovation system; and introduce change and dynamism into the economy. In the article, we also offer an empirical definition of knowledge-intensive innovative entrepreneurship, which we then use to identify its key characteristics and relevance. We conclude with recommendations for a future research agenda.},

In the STEM framework, particularly for younger children, the “E” and the “T” are considered to be missing letters, because few studies have concentrated on teaching and evaluating technology and engineering through ER activities. This study aimed to develop and test the efficacy of an ER protocol to teach robotics in a sample of 389 students, hypothesizing that girls would be as successful as boys. A Robotics Questionnaire assessing the basics of robotics was developed for this study. A Wilcoxon nonparametric test was performed in order to evaluate improvements (p < 0.05). A Mann–Whitney nonparametric test was performed in order to test the presence of gender differences (p < 0.05). Data indicated significant improvements for all the age ranges considered. No gender differences were found. In order to evaluate the efficacy of a didactic intervention utilizing ER, it is important to assess the impact on children's technological and engineering (robotics, in particular) knowledge.},

To put this number in perspective, robot sales in all of Europe and the Americas in 2016 reached 97,300 units (according to data from the International Federation of Robotics). Between 2005 and 2016, the operational stock of industrial robots in China increased at an annual average rate of 38 percent. In this paper, we describe the adoption of robots by China’s manufacturers using both aggregate industry-level and firm-level data, and we provide possible explanations from both the supply and demand sides for why robot use has risen so quickly in China. A key contribution of this paper is that we have collected some of the world’s first data on firms’ robot adoption behaviors with our China Employer-Employee Survey (CEES), which contains the first firm-level data that is representative of the entire Chinese manufacturing sector.</p>},

The proposed model results from the analysis and integration of the technology adoption model (TAM), green information technology adoption model (GITAM), and theory of planned behavior (TPB). To determine the predictive factors for internal organizational actors, the research team surveyed information on organizations belonging to Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, and Peru. Information was collected from strategic, tactical, and operational personnel. Data were collected from 499 organizational actors in the productive sector, processed, and analyzed using a structural equation model with the partial least squares technique. The study model explains, first there is an influence of the variables Industry 4.0 perceived ease of use (PEU) and Industry 4.0 perceived utility (PUT) on Industry 4.0 attitude towards use (ATU). Second, there is a positive influence of Industry 4.0 technological context (ICO), Industry 4.0 subjective norm (SNO), Industry 4.0 attitude (ATT), Industry 4.0 attitude towards to use (ATU), and Industry 4.0 attitude behavioral control (BCO) on intention to adopt Industry 4.0 in the organization (IAI). Third, what was not supported is the influence of Industry 4.0 technological context (ICO) on the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 in the organization (IAI). The model results are consistent with those of other studies on technology adoption, and propose a model for Industry 4.0, which is a significant contribution to this study, especially for developing countries.},

   abstract = {More intense floriculture activity in Ecuador could mean huge improvements for the country’s economic growth, while at the same time would be a sustainable exploitation of its natural resources. This study aims to help floriculture entrepreneurs in Ecuador with production planning, investment, and marketing strategies. With this in mind, two main objectives are addressed in the paper. The first one is to obtain an analytical overview of the world’s flower industry and the chief exporting and importing countries, as well as of the types of flowers that are offered and demanded. The second is to determine the competitive position of Ecuador’s flower industry and that of its direct competitors in the global cut flower marketplace. To accomplish the latter, we used Balassa’s and Hinloopen and Van Marrewijk’s measures and carried out statistical tests to validate the results. These indicated that both Ecuador and Colombia enjoy a strong comparative advantage among their direct competitors: the Netherlands, Kenya, and Ethiopia. Although the 2018 Logistics Performance Index and the 2017–2018 Global Competitiveness Index rankings put Ecuador in the 70th and 97th position worldwide, respectively, our findings show that Ecuador has the potential to achieve higher market shares in the flower trade globally. Consequently, strategic production policies should be implemented for Ecuadorian flower companies to adapt to the international flower trade requirements and for improving the production and supply chain technologies so that Ecuador can reach other foreign markets.},

   abstract = {The main problem of the exploration and production sector in the oil and gas industry worldwide, and especially in Ecuador, lies in the extreme environmental conditions inherent to each oilfield, which makes it difficult to perform daily tasks of maintenance or equipment verification. Due to these harsh environments, this industry has seen the need to implement bilateral tele-operation systems with a high degree of scalability that allows the interaction between equipment and trained personnel that could safely perform maintenance activities. In order to achieve this objective, it is necessary to select a standardized messaging protocol that meets the current needs of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and allows the efficient use of communication channels bandwidth. This paper presents the design of a bilateral tele-operation system that allows the operator to carry out maintenance or remote inspection activities in the Well-Pads located in Petroamazonas EP, Ecuador. For the development of this system, the MQTT protocol is selected over other IIoT protocols because of its high speed of response in real time as well as its low consumption of resources. In the local site a virtual reality environment developed in a 3D graphic engine is implemented. Through input devices an infinite transparency is obtained, besides transmitting the experience and skills of the operator to the slave through the senses of sight, hearing, and kinesthesis.},

En este sentido, la presente investigación tiene como propósito analizar de manera global los niveles de empleabilidad y de automatización; posteriormente se detalla el panorama industrial del país y se culmina con la identificación de las propuestas educativas vigentes, donde se especifican aquellos programas que deben ser potenciados para garantizar la existencia de profesionales que respondan a las particularidades del mercado moderno. Para la determinación de los resultados, se analizaron reportes de instituciones que indagan en la relación de automatización y empleabilidad y se aplicó una encuesta para conocer la percepción de las personas sobre la posibilidad del reemplazo a corto plazo de los puestos de trabajo. Por ello, el enfoque aplicado en el estudio fue enfoque mixto, con un diseño documental y de campo, y se determinó un alcance explicativo. Finalmente se puntualizan estudios que establecen que la automatización no aumentará los niveles de desempleo, sino que el desarrollo de los procesos computarizados creará nuevas oportunidades laborales relacionadas a las actividades cognitivas no rutinarias, donde las posibles&nbsp;carreras del futuro estarán orientadas al desarrollo de las habilidades emocionales y exigirán un alto nivel de creatividad.

First, this is because no significant technological innovations were envisioned, while the current academic offer does not support the establishment of this type of industrial design. This paper focuses on analyzing globally the levels of employability and automation. After then, the industrial landscape of the country was detailed and the identification of current educational proposals was also completed. This, however, specifies those programs that should be enhanced, to ensure the existence of professionals that respond to the particularities of the modern market. To determine the results, reports from institutions that investigate the relationship of automation and employability were analyzed. A survey was also applied to determine people's perception of the possibility of short-term replacement of jobs. A mixed approach was applied, with a documentary and field design, and an explanatory scope was determined. Finally, studies were performed which shows that automation will not increase unemployment levels, but that the&nbsp;development of computerized processes will create new job opportunities related to non-routine cognitive activities. Here, possible future careers will be oriented towards the development of emotional skills and based on a high level of creativity.},

This article shows a case study where, through a training program in ER, tools such as LEGO® Robotics and WeDo 2.0 are introduced to teachers of the Ministry of Education of Ecuador (online workshop). Mainly, our research reveals 1) the method for the implementation of a 5-module virtual workshop; and 2) an experimental study which validates that there are significant changes in the teachers' knowledge regarding ER after participating in the workshop. Finally, the shortcomings of the ER use, lessons learned and main key points are underlined.},

While much of the literature has focused on rich nations, the changes are quite likely to affect developing nations in important ways. The premise of the paper - which should be regarded as a thought-piece - is based on an extreme thought experiment. What does development look like when digital technology has rendered manufacturing jobless and many services freely traded? Our conclusion is that the service-led development path may become the norm rather than the exception; think India, not China. Since success in the service sector is based on quite different factors than success in manufacturing, development strategies and mindsets may have to change. This is an optimistic conclusion since it suggests that developing nations can directly export the source of their comparative advantage - low-cost labour - without having first to make goods with that labour.},
